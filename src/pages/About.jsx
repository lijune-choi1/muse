              <p>At Critique, we believe that great design emerges through thoughtful feedback and collaboration. Our mission is to make design critique accessible to everyoneâ€”from students to professionals, from independent creators to established studios.</p>
              
              <p>We're building a community where designers can receive honest, constructive feedback on their work, connect with fellow creators, and iterate on their designs based on valuable input. By democratizing the critique process, we aim to elevate design standards across the industry and open doors for talented individuals who might otherwise be overlooked.</p>
