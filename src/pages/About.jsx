              <h2 className="section-header">Our Mission</h2>
              <p>At Muse, we believe that great design emerges through thoughtful critique and collaboration. Our mission is to make design critique and funding accessible to everyone‚Äîfrom students to professionals, from independent creators to established studios.</p>
              
              <p>We're building a community where designers can receive honest, constructive feedback on their work, connect with fellow creators, and potentially find funding for their projects. By democratizing the critique process, we aim to elevate design standards across the industry and open doors for talented individuals who might otherwise be overlooked.</p>

            <section className="about-section">
              <h2 className="section-header">Our Story</h2>
              <p>Muse began in a graduate design studio at Rhode Island School of Design in 2023. Frustrated by the limitations of traditional critique methods and the challenges of finding design funding, our founders created a simple web app to facilitate better feedback among classmates.</p>
              
              <p>The tool quickly gained popularity beyond their immediate circle, revealing a widespread need for better critique and funding channels in the design community. With input from designers, educators, and industry professionals, Muse evolved into the platform you see today.</p>
              
              <p>Backed by leading design-focused venture capital, Muse launched publicly in January 2024 and has since grown to serve over 10,000 designers across 40 countries.</p>
